# Knuckles Glide Behavior Mod for Mania Decomp

REQUIRES GAMEAPI TO BE BUILT MANUALLY

This mod fixes Knuckles Glide Landing behavior to be accurate to Sonic 3 & Knuckles by allowing him to jump or spindash out of it, but not walk or move otherwise. This mod additionally comes with the Glide physics altered as well, making it much more accurate to Sonic 3 & Knuckles.

This mod was created as a proof of concept for GameAPI's flexibility in utilizing public gamestates to smoothly hook in alterations to game mechanics that otherwise could not be edited. It will be updated when future repos for the decompilation exist that fix small oversights (Gravity_False not being part of the public states).
